This function takes an a matrix that represents a system of equations and performs "LU" factorization to aid in solving the system. The function is capable of performing pivoting as well.

The inputs are:
1. A - coefficient matrix

The outputs are
1. L - lower triangular matrix, with 1's along the diagonals
2. U - upper triangular matrix
3. P - the pivot matrix
